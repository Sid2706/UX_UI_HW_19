   Bonjour!  My name is Sid Ahmed Ouadah, and I am a freelance UX/UI designer and quality ssurance  
   specialist.I have a background in law, sales, and digital advertising, which allows me to better understand and anticipate user needs. 
  I enjoy turning raw ideas into useful and 
  innovative products that enhance user experience.
  <p>I discovered my passion for user experience a few years ago while working 
  as a rideshare driver, seeing firsthand the many pain points myself and other drivers faced while driving
   and interacting with the app simultaneously.  My curiosity led me to seek 
   out ways to improve this process, and after taking several online courses to better understand user experience
    and user needs, I confirmed that this was the right path for me.
   </p>
    My desire to solve users problem quickly developed into a passion, and in
     2021 I decided to further foster this by attending the UC Berkeley Extension bootcamp. This is where I gained much experience and a certificate in UX/UI design.
       <p> Outside of design, I am a huge Football (or as  Americans call it, Soccer   ) 
       fan, and enjoy exploring the great outdoors and trying new food.
       </p>
       <p> Currently,I am open to new opportunities and fun projects.
       Please do not hesitate to contact me!
